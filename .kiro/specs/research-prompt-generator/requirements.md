# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a structured research prompt generator for the GovTrack project based on the comprehensive system research document. The generator will produce academic-quality research prompts that incorporate specific parameters including timeframe restrictions (2020-2025) and APA 7th Edition citation requirements. This tool will help researchers and developers conduct focused, methodical research on government transparency platforms, corruption mitigation technologies, and civic engagement systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to generate structured research prompts based on the GovTrack project documentation, so that I can conduct focused academic research with proper citation standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a research prompt THEN the system SHALL generate a structured prompt that includes all key aspects from the SystemResearch.json file
2. WHEN generating the prompt THEN the system SHALL include specific parameters requiring sources from 2020-2025 timeframe
3. WHEN creating research guidelines THEN the system SHALL specify APA 7th Edition citation requirements for both in-text citations and reference lists
4. WHEN structuring the prompt THEN the system SHALL organize research areas into logical categories covering transparency, accountability, civic engagement, and technical implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an academic researcher, I want the research prompt to include specific research questions and methodologies, so that I can conduct comprehensive and systematic research on government transparency platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating research questions THEN the system SHALL create questions covering problem identification, solution design, ethical considerations, and implementation challenges
2. WHEN defining methodology THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate research approaches including literature review, case study analysis, and comparative studies
3. WHEN specifying scope THEN the system SHALL define clear boundaries for research focus areas including technical, social, and policy dimensions
4. WHEN providing guidance THEN the system SHALL include instructions for evaluating source credibility and relevance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the research prompt to align with the GovTrack project's ethical framework and objectives, so that research outcomes support responsible development and implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incorporating ethical considerations THEN the system SHALL reference the four key ethical principles from the original document (beneficence, justice, autonomy, transparency)
2. WHEN defining research objectives THEN the system SHALL align with GovTrack's SMART objectives and societal impact goals
3. WHEN structuring research areas THEN the system SHALL include bias identification, inclusivity assessment, and privacy considerations
4. WHEN providing context THEN the system SHALL reference relevant international frameworks and best practices mentioned in the original research

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or implementer, I want the research prompt to include technical and implementation-focused research areas, so that I can gather information relevant to building and deploying the GovTrack platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining technical research areas THEN the system SHALL include questions about web technologies, database design, API integration, and mobile development
2. WHEN addressing implementation challenges THEN the system SHALL prompt research on scalability, security, user experience, and accessibility
3. WHEN considering deployment THEN the system SHALL include research areas covering hosting, maintenance, and user adoption strategies
4. WHEN evaluating solutions THEN the system SHALL prompt comparative analysis of similar platforms and technologies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance reviewer, I want the research prompt to include validation criteria and output specifications, so that research results meet academic and professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying output requirements THEN the system SHALL define expected deliverables including annotated bibliography, literature review, and research synthesis
2. WHEN setting quality standards THEN the system SHALL require peer-reviewed sources and authoritative government/institutional publications
3. WHEN defining citation requirements THEN the system SHALL provide specific examples of proper APA 7th Edition formatting for various source types
4. WHEN establishing validation THEN the system SHALL include criteria for assessing research completeness and relevance to GovTrack objectives
